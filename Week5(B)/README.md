# Week 6 :8-12 February, 2021
# Problem Statement:
- Consider grades earned in each of the courses as random variables and learn the
dependencies between courses.
- Consider grades earned in each of the courses as random variables and learn the
dependencies between courses.
- What grade will a student get in PH100 if he earns DD in EC100, CC in IT101 and CD in
MA101.
- The last column in the data file indicates whether a student qualifies for an internship
program or not. From the given data, take 70 percent data for training and build a naive
Bayes classifier (considering that the grades earned in different courses are independent
of each other) which takes in the studentâ€™s performance and returns the qualification
status with a probability. Test your classifier on the remaining 30 percent data. Repeat
this experiment for 20 random selection of training and testing data. Report results about
the accuracy of your classifier.
-  Repeat 4, considering that the grades earned in different courses may be dependent.
