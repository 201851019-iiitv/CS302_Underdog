# Week 1 :  11 Jan - 15 Jan 2021
# Problem Statement:
- Write a pseudocode for a graph search agent. Represent the agent in the form of a flow
chart. Clearly mention all the implementation details with reasons.
- Write a collection of functions imitating the environment for Puzzle-8.
- Describe what is Iterative Deepening Search.
- Considering the cost associated with every move to be the same (uniform cost), write a
function which can backtrack and produce the path taken to reach the goal state from the
source/ initial state.
- Generate Puzzle-8 instances with the goal state at depth “d”.
- Prepare a table indicating the memory and time requirements to solve Puzzle-8 instances
(depth “d”) using your graph search agent.
