# CS302_Week1
this contains the solution of week 1

# Problem Statement:
A. Write a pseudocode for a graph search agent. Represent the agent in the form of a flow
chart. Clearly mention all the implementation details with reasons.
B. Write a collection of functions imitating the environment for Puzzle-8.
C. Describe what is Iterative Deepening Search.
D. Considering the cost associated with every move to be the same (uniform cost), write a
function which can backtrack and produce the path taken to reach the goal state from the
source/ initial state.
E. Generate Puzzle-8 instances with the goal state at depth “d”.
F. Prepare a table indicating the memory and time requirements to solve Puzzle-8 instances
(depth “d”) using your graph search agent.
