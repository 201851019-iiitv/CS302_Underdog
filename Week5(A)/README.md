# Week 5 :1-5 February, 2021
# Problem Statement:
- What is the size of the game tree for Noughts
and Crosses? Sketch the game tree.
- Read about the game of Nim (a player left
with no move losing the game). For the
initial configuration of the game with three
piles of objects as shown in Figure, show that
regardless of the strategy of player-1,
player-2 will always win. Try to explain the
reason with the MINIMAX value backup
argument on the game tree..
- Implement MINIMAX and alpha-beta pruning agents. Report on number of evaluated
nodes for Noughts and Crosses game tree.
- Using recurrence relation show that under perfect ordering of leaf nodes, the alpha-beta
pruning time complexity is O(bm/2
), where b is the effective branching factor and m is the
depth of the tree.
